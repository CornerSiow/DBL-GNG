# DBL-GNG
Distributed Batch Learning Growing Neural Gas.

DBL-GNG is to used to extract the toplogical map from point clouds using matrix calculation, so it can process faster.

Please find the code in the example folder for the python code of GNG:
1) standard GNG
2) DBL-GNG (proposed method)
3) FCM-BL-GNG https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jaciii/25/6/25_1011/_article/-char/ja/ 
4) MS-BL-GNG (coming soon)

# DBL-GNG
Distributed Batch Learning Growing Neural Gas.

DBL-GNG is to used to extract the toplogical map from point clouds using matrix calculation, so it can process faster.

Please find the examples for:
1) standard GNG
2) DBL-GNG (proposed method)
3) FCM-GNG (coming soon)
4) MS-BL-GNG (coming soon)
